    <p><strong>Dunzo Daily — Increasing Average Order Value (AOV)</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Summary</strong>: Dunzo Daily is a convenience delivery service that aims to deliver daily essentials within 19 minutes. The service has two key customer groups: those who order small, frequent baskets (low AOV) and those with larger, planned baskets (high AOV). This study outlines a product strategy to increase AOV by 30–40% among two key customer segments—low- basket and mid-basket users—using targeted nudges, replenishment triggers, and tailored merchandising.</p>

    <h2>Understanding the Customer Segments</h2>

    <p><strong>Low AOV segment</strong> includes customers who order items worth ₹150–₹200 per order. These users typically order 3–4 small items at high frequency (7–8 times a month). They usually purchase products like milk, bread, eggs, and fruits.</p>

    <p><strong>Mid AOV segment</strong> includes customers who purchase items worth ₹300–₹400. These customers order 5–6 items and combine essentials with indulgence products.</p>

    <h2>Objective</h2>

    <p><strong>Increase AOV by 30–40% for both low- and mid-basket customers</strong> by encouraging them to add more items through:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Personalised nudges</li>
      <li>Replenishment suggestions</li>
      <li>Optimised home screen merchandising</li>
      <li>The incorporation of unit economics-driven bundles</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Strategy</h2>

    <p><strong>Segment 1: Low AOV (₹150–₹200)</strong><br>
    The idea is to nudge these customers with personalised suggestions based on their previous orders. Since they typically order 3–4 daily essentials regularly, replenishment-based reminders can be used to increase their overall basket value.</p>

    <h3>Approach</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Introduce “Frequently Bought Together” suggestions on the home screen and checkout page</li>
      <li>Utilise replenishment triggers like “You last ordered milk 4 days ago”</li>
      <li>Add personalised coupons such as “Get ₹20 off when you buy 2 more items”</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Segment 2: Mid AOV (₹300–₹400)</h2>

    <p>Mid-tier customers often mix essentials with indulgence or impulse purchases. These users can be nudged to add more items through strategic category placement and price thresholds.</p>

    <h3>Approach</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Promote value-pack bundles like “Buy 2 Get 1 Free”</li>
      <li>Highlight complementary categories (e.g., fruits + snacks, dairy + bakery)</li>
      <li>Use cart-threshold-based incentives: “Add items worth ₹50 more to save ₹20”</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>This product strategy aims to increase AOV across low and mid-tier customers by tapping into behavioural nudges, personalised recommendations, inventory replenishment cues, and optimised merchandising. A combination of these approaches can help increase the average basket size by 30–40%, significantly improving Dunzo Daily’s unit economics and customer retention.</p>
