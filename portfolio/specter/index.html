      <h2>1. The Core Problem in Venture Discovery.</h2>

      <p>My journey with Specter began as an intern, joining a small team trying to solve one question that always frustrated investors: why do funds learn about promising founders so late?</p>

      <p>By the time a company officially surfaces through a funding announcement, a landing page, or a Product Hunt launch, most serious conversations have already happened behind the scenes. Investors needed a way to understand entrepreneurial intent before any “public company signal” existed. That problem became the foundation of Specter Talent. The product was built on the belief that early signals hide in plain sight, and if we could learn how to capture them, we could give investors a view of the future before it became obvious. Over the next five years, I went from supporting its early experiments to building its signal logic, leading the product, and helping shape how Talent detects founders long before anyone else knows they’re building.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2. First Hypothesis: New Companies as the Primary Signal.</h2>

      <p>In the earliest phase, we tried to detect “New Companies.” We thought that new entities forming online would always be the first and most relevant signal. We scraped incorporations, domain registrations, fresh landing pages, half-formed product listings, and tiny web footprints. The premise seemed reasonable, but data and repeated failures showed us the opposite. Many company entries were experimental or never went anywhere. Some were placeholders, paper shells, or early registrations not tied to genuine intent. More importantly, we kept finding cases where the founder’s decision to build began much earlier than the company’s public trace. That realization forced us to rethink everything. If the company signal was arriving late, then we had to look further upstream.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3. Breakthrough Insight: Founders Always Surface Before Companies.</h2>

      <p>What ultimately reshaped Talent was a pattern I kept encountering while reviewing thousands of raw signals, manually verifying founder identities and mapping context across platforms. People reveal intent much earlier than companies do. They update LinkedIn bios to “Stealth,” “TBA,” “NewCo,” or leave small breadcrumbs just after exiting a previous role. They start GitHub repos aligned with a problem space. They sign up for accelerator cohorts before they launch anything public. They quietly add themselves to founder databases. They show changes in activity rhythm and platform presence that align with someone preparing to build.</p>

      <p>During months of parsing signals, one rule kept repeating itself: whenever a person left a previous role or closed a job position and then added a stealth marker soon after, the odds of them building something serious went up dramatically. What looked like a vague online breadcrumb was actually one of the strongest early indicators of intent, and it showed up consistently enough that we internalized it into our logic. That gave us a clear direction for what Talent should be: a founder-first discovery layer.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. Evolving the North Star Metric: Weekly New Founders Discovered</h2>

      <p>Once we understood that the earliest signals existed at the founder level, our measure of success changed. In the beginning, we focused on how many new companies we surfaced weekly. But the more we looked into this, the clearer it became that company detection wasn’t the right frame. It was too late in the formation cycle, too inconsistent in value, and too noisy. So we shifted the North Star metric to the number of new founders discovered weekly.</p>

      <p>Weekly mattered more than daily because it matched the tempo at which high-quality signals emerge, and it allowed enough space for verification, enrichment, and contextual confidence. That metric became the backbone of how we judged Talent’s performance. It forced discipline: fewer noisy flags, more credible detections, deeper data per founder, and a mindset built around signal quality rather than raw volume.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>5. My Role and Journey: From Intern to Investment Analyst to Leading Talent.</h2>

      <p>I landed at Specter after cold mailing Marco, the Co-Founder, and joined as an intern with my role focused entirely on helping build Talent’s foundational intelligence. My work was brutally hands-on. Each week, I drowned in data, scraping sources, parsing unstructured text, reconciling names, comparing fields across platforms, rejecting weak signals, and validating patterns that seemed promising but needed proof. I worked with engineers spread across Australia, Vietnam, and London, reviewing outputs, debating thresholds, testing hypotheses, and shaping the detection logic step by step.</p>

      <p>My exposure to user needs came indirectly. Analysts at VC Funds often highlighted data points they wished existed, interpretations they struggled with, or signals they wished had stronger enrichment. Over time, patterns emerged in the importance of background, previous startup experience, location, educational context, sector relevance, or whether a founder was technical. Each time a consistent request was repeated, we expanded the logic to incorporate it.</p>

      <p>As Talent matured, I gradually moved into an Investment Analyst role and eventually took full ownership of the product. Leading Talent meant refining its logic, owning enrichment cycles, curating weekly discoveries, and ensuring that what surfaced actually mattered to the people relying on it. It also meant hustling constantly — fixing scrapes, rebuilding broken signals, correcting misfiring data models, and keeping the product learning as fast as the market itself.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>6. Early Delivery: From CSV Files to Zoho Creator.</h2>

      <p>Talent didn’t start with a polished interface. It began with weekly CSV dumps. Those early files validated that what we were surfacing mattered. But CSVs lacked context and flattened nuance, so the next step was visualizing the data.</p>

      <p>Our first interface was Zoho Creator — functional but limited. It couldn’t express the richness of the intelligence behind Talent. The more data points we extracted, the clearer the UI bottleneck became. That disconnect eventually triggered the decision to build a dedicated interface capable of showing signal strength, founder context, sequence of activity, platform footprints, and more.</p>

      <h2>7. Signal Design and the Birth of the Signal Score.</h2>

      <p>One of the most meaningful evolutions in Talent’s logic came from our attempts to rank founder intent. Not all signals were equal. A domain registration without any context meant little. A stealth keyword placed months after an employment change was weaker than the same keyword placed within days.</p>

      <p>Through thousands of samples, consistent patterns emerged — correlating timing, positioning, and context with the seriousness of intent. This became the foundation of the Signal Score, our internal metric that quantified credibility by weighing signal strength, sequencing, contextual factors, and cross-source validation.</p>

      <p>Signal Score made Talent more discerning, cutting noise, elevating meaningful activity, and allowing analysts to focus on people most likely to be building something real.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>8. Understanding User Needs Through Second-Degree Conversations.</h2>

      <p>I didn’t sit in the demo calls, but I learned from the patterns that came back from them. Analysts requested metadata fields. Partners wanted more context. Users questioned gaps or unclear attributes.</p>

      <p>Each repeated request shaped Talent’s information architecture. Location. Previous founder experience. Education. Sector relevance. Technical background. Contextual explanations. User needs emerged not from structured interviews, but from recurring friction points — and those shaped the system more than anything else.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>9. A Weekly Feed of Founder Discovery.</h2>

      <p>The weekly founder feed became one of Talent’s simplest yet most powerful surfaces. It captured the pulse of emerging markets before they existed. Some weeks, clusters appeared around automation, others around climate, fintech, or AI.</p>

      <p>Seeing founders before companies emerged allowed analysts to understand where innovation energy was moving, long before the market caught up.</p>

      <h2>10. Talent as a Revenue Driver: The Product That Carried Specter.</h2>

      <p>Today, Talent contributes roughly 60% of Specter’s revenue. In a crowded space of alternative data providers, it stands out because it delivers something most platforms cannot: visibility into people before they become companies.</p>

      <p>From CSV experiment to core business driver, Talent proved that founder intelligence isn’t just insightful — it’s commercially essential.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>11. The Front-End Evolution: Reflecting the Intelligence We Built.</h2>

      <p>Our dedicated front-end changed everything. Fields had structure. Profiles had depth. Signal Scores offered clarity. Sequences became traceable. Patterns became visible.</p>

      <p>The interface finally matched the intelligence behind Talent. It helped analysts interpret early signals as structured stories rather than scattered breadcrumbs.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>12. What Building Talent Taught Me.</h2>

      <p>Five years of building Talent taught me how messy early-stage markets are — and how much clarity emerges when you sit with noise long enough. It taught me how to read digital exhaust as direction, how to separate weak fingerprints from strong intent, and how to spot patterns in founders before the world sees their companies.</p>

      <p>It reshaped how I think about products, data, and venture. More than anything, it taught me that companies are lagging indicators — founders are leading indicators.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>13. Closing Reflection.</h2>

      <p>Specter Talent began with a question about companies, but became a study of the people behind them. Entrepreneurial intent leaks early — if you know what to look for.</p>

      <p>I’m grateful to have helped build a system that detects those people. The years I spent crawling data, fixing signals, refining logic, and watching patterns form fundamentally shaped how I think about innovation.</p>

      <p>If you want to see what’s coming next, you follow the builders first.</p>
