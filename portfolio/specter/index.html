      <h2>1. The Core Problem in Venture Discovery.</h2>

      <p>My journey with Specter began as an intern, joining a small team trying to solve one question that always frustrated investors: why do funds learn about promising founders so late?</p>

      <p>By the time a company officially surfaces through a funding announcement, a landing page, or a Product Hunt launch, most serious conversations have already happened behind the scenes. Investors needed a way to understand entrepreneurial intent before any “public company signal” existed. That problem became the foundation of Specter Talent. The product was built on the belief that early signals hide in plain sight, and if we could learn how to capture them, we could give investors a view of the future before it became obvious. Over the next five years, I went from supporting its early experiments to building its signal logic, leading the product, and helping shape how Talent detects founders long before anyone else knows they’re building.</p>

      <h2>2. First Hypothesis:  New Companies as the Primary Signal.</h2>

      <p>In the earliest phase, we tried to detect “New Companies.” We thought that new entities forming online would always be the first and most relevant signal. We scraped incorporations, domain registrations, fresh landing pages, half-formed product listings, and tiny web footprints. The premise seemed reasonable, but data and repeated failures showed us the opposite. Many company entries were experimental or never went anywhere. Some were placeholders, paper shells, or early registrations not tied to genuine intent. More importantly, we kept finding cases where the founder’s decision to build began much earlier than the company’s public trace. That realization forced us to rethink everything. If the company signal was arriving late, then we had to look further upstream.</p>

      <h2>3. Breakthrough Insight:  Founders Always Surface Before Companies.</h2>

      <p>What ultimately reshaped Talent was a pattern I kept encountering while reviewing thousands of raw signals, manually verifying founder identities and mapping context across platforms. People reveal intent much earlier than companies do. They update LinkedIn bios to “Stealth,” “TBA,” “NewCo,” or leave small breadcrumbs just after exiting a previous role. They start GitHub repos aligned with a problem space. They sign up for accelerator cohorts before they launch anything public. They quietly add themselves to founder databases. They show changes in activity rhythm and platform presence that align with someone preparing to build. During months of parsing signals, one rule kept repeating itself: whenever a person left a previous role or closed a job position and then added a stealth marker soon after, the odds of them building something serious went up dramatically. What looked like a vague online breadcrumb was actually one of the strongest early indicators of intent, and it showed up consistently enough that we internalized it into our logic. That gave us a clear direction for what Talent should be: a founder-first discovery layer.</p>

      <!-- rest of your article content unchanged -->
      <h2>4. Evolving the North Star Metric:  Weekly New Founders Discovered</h2>
      <p>Once we understood that the earliest signals existed at the founder level, our measure of success changed. In the beginning, we focused on how many new companies we surfaced weekly. But the more we looked into this, the clearer it became that company detection wasn’t the right frame. It was too late in the formation cycle, too inconsistent in value, and too noisy. So we shifted the North Star metric to the number of new founders discovered weekly. Weekly mattered more than daily because it matched the tempo at which high-quality signals emerge, and it allowed enough space for verification, enrichment, and contextual confidence. That metric became the backbone of how we judged Talent’s performance. It forced discipline: fewer noisy flags, more credible detections, deeper data per founder, and a mindset built around signal quality rather than raw volume.</p>

      <h2>5. My Role and Journey:  From Intern to Investment Analyst to Leading Talent.</h2>
      <p>I landed at Specter after cold mailing Marco, the Co-Founder, and joined as an intern with my role focused entirely on helping build Talent’s foundational intelligence. My work was brutally hands-on. Each week, I drowned in data, scraping sources, parsing unstructured text, reconciling names, comparing fields across platforms, rejecting weak signals, and validating patterns that seemed promising but needed proof. I worked with engineers spread across Australia, Vietnam, and London, reviewing outputs, debating thresholds, testing hypotheses, and shaping the detection logic step by step. It wasn’t glamorous work, but it gave me an unusually deep understanding of what early-stage intent looks like before it solidifies into product or company form.</p>

      <h2>Closing Reflection</h2>
      <p>Specter Talent started with a question about companies, but over time, it became a study of the people behind them. It revealed that entrepreneurial intent leaks early, if you know where to look and how to interpret it. It showed that finding the future is not about chasing launched products, it’s about understanding the individuals who are quietly building them.</p>
