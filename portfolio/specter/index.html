    <!-- =============================== -->

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Specter Talent is a product built to help investors discover founders before their companies exist. This case study explores how the earliest hypotheses around “New Company” signals evolved into a more refined understanding of founder-first detection.</p>

    <h2>2. Why Companies Are a Late Signal</h2>
    <p>The earliest phase of Talent focused on detecting “New Companies.” We assumed incorporations, domain registrations, and early landing pages were the first meaningful signals. After studying thousands of these signals, we discovered the opposite. Most early “company” signals were noise—temporary experiments, shell structures, or placeholder landing pages. Company formation was rarely the first evidence of real founder intent.</p>

    <h2>3. Founders Always Surface Before Companies</h2>
    <p>Through continuous analysis of LinkedIn, GitHub, accelerators, domain trails, and online communities, we observed that founders reveal intent far earlier than any company footprint appears. These breadcrumbs included title changes, “stealth” markers, early repo creation, accelerator applications, and subtle shifts in public activity. Founders surface before companies, and this became the central insight that reshaped Talent’s detection logic.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Signals & Sources</h2>
    <p>Talent aggregated multiple signal types across public platforms. These included:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>LinkedIn title changes and stealth markers</li>
      <li>New GitHub repos and activity shifts</li>
      <li>Domain registrations</li>
      <li>Accelerator signups</li>
      <li>Founder mentions across niche communities</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Individually, these signals were noisy. In combination, they formed a high-confidence composite indicator of emerging founders.</p>

    <h2>5. Building the Detection Pipeline</h2>
    <p>The Talent pipeline evolved into a multi-stage process: ingest → normalize → enrich → dedupe → score. Identity resolution was the most difficult part. Matching names across platforms required rule-based heuristics reinforced with manual verification. Over time, this dramatically improved precision and reduced false positives.</p>

    <h2>6. Product & UX Decisions</h2>
    <p>We prioritized precision over recall. Investors needed concise, high-quality founder leads rather than noisy lists. The UX emphasized clarity: signal badges, provenance insights, triage shortcuts, and links to raw evidence. This reduced cognitive load and increased trust in the surfaced leads.</p>

    <h2>7. Distribution & Growth</h2>
    <p>Slack alerts, email digests, and personalized watchlists created strong engagement loops. These integrations placed Talent directly into investors’ workflows, increasing retention and making founder discovery a continuous process rather than a weekly check-in.</p>

    <h2>8. Success Metrics</h2>
    <p>The primary metric was weekly new founders discovered. Supporting metrics included lead-to-intro conversion, enrichment completeness, and precision quality. Over several iterations, Talent significantly reduced noise and increased the proportion of high-quality founder discoveries.</p>

    <h2>9. My Role & Learnings</h2>
    <p>I worked across signal research, data quality, identity resolution, and product prioritization. The biggest learning was understanding how subtle patterns reveal emerging founder intent—and how to build a system capable of detecting those signals early and reliably.</p>

    <h2>10. Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Specter Talent shifted the framework of startup discovery. Instead of tracking companies, we learned to track the people who build them—months before anything became public. This founder-first perspective reshaped how the team approached early detection and influenced how modern investors source opportunities.</p>
