        <p>Here are some things I believe:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>ABL: Always Be Learning.</li>
            <li>Every skill is a muscle to be exercised.</li>
            <li>Changing your mind based on new data is a superpower.
                <div class="sub-point">(Most people don't ever change their minds)</div>
            </li>
            <li>Speed is under-appreciated in almost every context.</li>
            <li>Tremendous outcomes require tremendous amounts of hard work.
                <div class="sub-point">(Smarts alone are not enough)</div>
            </li>
            <li>Luck matters a lot, but you can help luck find you.</li>
            <li>Do less to do more.</li>
            <li>Take care of yourself in order to take care of others.</li>
            <li>Be deliberate, and comfortable with risk.
                <div class="sub-point">(Most people are impulsive, and risk-averse)</div>
            </li>
            <li>Combine optimism about technology with realism about humanity.</li>
            <li>Life is too short to play zero-sum games.</li>
        </ul>
